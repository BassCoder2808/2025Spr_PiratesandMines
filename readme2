The goal of this project is to design a logic-based puzzle game played on an n x n grid. Each cell in the grid can be one of three types: a treasure (+1 point), a landmine (–1 point), or an empty cell (0 points). Empty cells display clues—the sum of the values of their orthogonal neighbors (top, bottom, left, right). Using these clues, players must logically deduce and uniquely determine the correct placement of all treasures and landmines in the grid. The game concludes once all cells are filled
